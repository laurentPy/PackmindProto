This means either that no classes have been passed to the rule at all, or that no classes passed to the rule matched the `that()` clause. To allow rules being evaluated without checking any classes you can either use `ArchRule.allowEmptyShould(true)` on a single rule or set the configuration property `archRule.failOnEmptyShould = false` to change the behavior globally."
